Initial support for multiplayer!

* One player starts a new multiplayer game.
* They share the details using their method of choice (e.g. QR Code, SMS, email, etc).
* Each player can then play the same game on their own devices.

This is all still quite new, so any feedback on the process is very welcome (though please note this is not intended to be a realtime / network multiplayer yet).
