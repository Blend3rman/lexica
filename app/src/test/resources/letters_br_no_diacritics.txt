# 
# br_no_diacritics language letter distributions for Lexica
# 
# Automatically generated by a genetic algorithm run with 1000 iterations
#  - Each iteration, 100 4 x 4 Lexica boards were generated.
#  - The fitness function looks at how many words can be played on each of these boards.
#  - Fitness is defined as "(Mean * Mean) - (Standard Deviation * Standard Deviation).
#
# The goal is boards that on average have a high number of words available (boards with zero or only a small number of words are not good),
# but the standard deviation is low (some languages tend to result in boards with hundreds of words, which is also not particularly great).
#
# Fitness for this probability:
#   Min: 19, mean: 100, max: 187, stddev: 35, score: 7702
